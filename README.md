University of Milano-Bicocca, 2026. [BSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.unimib.it/undergraduate/artificial-intelligence).

## Aims

Machine learning and data mining are quickly becoming essential techniques in the field of (astro)physics. Such powerful tools provide precious insights into the laws governing natural processes and shed light on the information contained in experimental datasets. This lab provides a quick introduction to such topics, equipping students with some essential background to apply their data-science knowledge to core physical problems.

Here are some useful textbooks. The first one is easier, the second one is amazing, the third is short and sweet, the fourth and fifth ones are for the true Bayesians...

## Setup

**Coding**. Each class will be about 1h of lecture and about 3h of coding. You will need to run python, see [here for instructions](pythonsetup.md).

**News+emails**: [elearning.unipv.it/course/section.php?id=102930](https://elearning.unipv.it/course/section.php?id=102930)

**Recordings**: [elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=60763](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=60763)



## Exams

Each lecture has an exercise at the end (actually, most of the time in class is dedicated to completing these problems!). At the end of the class, you will have to submit your codes showcasing what you've done on these problems. There will then be a short oral exam to verify that you have appropriately understood the course material. The outcome will be provided as a passed / not passed statement (no numbers).

You do not need to submit assignments after every lecture. Please share them all together at the end of the course, when you are ready. See [here for detailed instructions](examsubmission.md).

To submit your codes, register on github.com, create a new **private** repository called `machinelearning4physics_bicocca_2026_solutions`, upload your files, share it with the two of us (usernames `dgerosa` and `UPDATE`), and send us an email when you are done.  We will then arrange the date of the oral exam.
